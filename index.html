          <!--<p>
            Language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) have shown impressive abilities in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
            However, relying solely on their parameters to encode a wealth of world knowledge requires a prohibitively large number of parameters and hence massive computing, and they often struggle to learn long-rail knowledge (Roberts et al., 2020; Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2022). 
            Moreover, these parametric LMs are fundamentally incapable of adapting over time (De Cao et al., 2021; Lazaridou et al., 2021; Kasai et al., 2022), often hallucinate (Shuster et al., 2021), and may leak private data from the
            training corpus (Carlini et al., 2021). To overcome these limitations, there has been growing interest in retrieval-based LMs (Guu et al., 2020; Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2022b; Min et al., 2022),
            which incorporate a non-parametric datastore (e.g., text chunks from an external corpus) with their parametric counterparts. Retrieval-based LMs can outperform LMs without retrieval by a large margin with much fewer parameters (Mallen et al., 2022), can update their knowledge by replacing their retrieval corpora (Izacard et al., 2022b), and provide citations for users to easily verify and evaluate the predictions (Menick et al., 2022; Bohnet et al., 2022).
          </p>
          <p>
            In this tutorial, we aim to provide a comprehensive and coherent overview of recent
            advances in retrieval-based LMs. We will start
            by first providing preliminaries covering the foundations of LM (e.g., masked LMs, autoregressive LMs) and retrieval systems (e.g., nearest-neighbor search methods widely used in neural retrieval systems; Karpukhin et al. 2020). We will then focus
            on recent progress in architectures, learning approaches, and applications of retrieval-based LMs.
          </p>-->
          <p>
            Foundation Models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced many research areas. In particular, LLMs offer significant advantages for recommender systems, making them valuable tools for personalized recommendations. For example, by formulating various recommendation tasks such as rating prediction, sequential recommendation, straightforward recommendation, and explanation generation into language instructions, LLMs make it possible to build universal recommendation engines that can handle different recommendation tasks. Additionally, LLMs have a remarkable capacity for understanding natural language, enabling them to comprehend user preferences, item descriptions, and contextual information to generate more accurate and relevant recommendations, leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement. This tutorial introduces Foundation Models such as LLMs for recommendation. We introduce how recommender system advanced from shallow models to deep models and to large models, how LLMs enable generative recommendation in contrast to traditional discriminative recommendation, and how to build LLM-based recommender systems. We cover multiple perspectives of LLM-based recommendation, including data preparation, model design, model pre-training, fine-tuning and prompting, model evaluation, multi-modality and multi-task learning, as well as trustworthy perspectives of LLM-based recommender systems such as fairness and transparency.

        <ul>
          <h2 class="title is-4">Introduction</h2>
          <p>We introduce datasets that facilitate LLM-based recommendation models. This is particularly important for data-centric machine learning such as LLM-based recommender systems, since the pre-training of LLMs largely determines the ability and utility of LLM-based recommendation.</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="title is-4">Large language models for recommender system</h2>
          <p>We organize and introduce recent LLM-based recommendation models, their relationships, various pre-training, fine-tuning and prompting strategies of LLM-based recommendation models, and possible directions for future improvements.</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="title is-4">Trustworthy Large language models for recommender system</h2>
          <p>We introduce research on the trustworthiness on LLM-based recommender models, including hallucination, fairness, transparency, robustness, and controllability.</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="title is-4">Toolkit [<a href="https://github.com/agiresearch/OpenP5"><b>OpenP5</b></a>]</h2>
          <p>We introduce existing open-source models and platforms to facilitate LLM-based recommendation research, including both LLM backbones such as T5 and LLaMA, and LLM-based recommendation platforms such as OpenP5.</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="title is-4">Summary</h2>
          <p>Finally, we introduce existing industrial LLM systems that support recommender functionality and their advantages and problems to improve. Examples include ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing and Google Bard.</p>
        </ul>
